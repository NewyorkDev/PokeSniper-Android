## POKEHASH KEYS

**As PokeSniper v1.5.7-BETA16 you won't need to manually input shared key, the app will obtain the key from our server. Just leave the PokeHash key option blank or empty (if you used previous shared key, just delete it). This will be more easy to use without checking this page every once in a while.**

As Pokemon GO v0.57.4 update, Legacy API couldn't be used anymore and right now you need to use Pokehash key. The key can be obtained by buying it at

~~For users who can't afford it or want to use our shared key, just use below key(s) and add it to PokeSniper-Android. Will updated if it's expired, so check this page every once awhile.~~
